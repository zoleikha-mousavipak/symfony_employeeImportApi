## Installation

1. Clone this repo.

2. If you are working with Docker Desktop for Mac, ensure **you have enabled `VirtioFS` for your sharing implementation**. `VirtioFS` brings improved I/O performance for operations on bind mounts. Enabling VirtioFS will automatically enable Virtualization framework.

3. Go inside folder `./docker` and run `docker compose up -d` to start containers.

4. You should work inside the `php` container. This project is configured to work with [Remote Container](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension for Visual Studio Code, so you could run `Reopen in container` command after open the project.

5. Inside the `php` container, run `composer install` to install dependencies from `/var/www/symfony` folder.
